        // an if statement. A better alternative would be to store the value of the condition and create a child that will execute if and
        // only if the condition is true. That is, the Execute... method in autogenerated code would return a bool indicating whether we
        // should Skip the node, and then we would use the Skip feature (tentatively implemented below) to skip the relevant code if
        // necessary. (1b) This could result in too many command chunks. We might then want to create a new command chunk only below
        // some parallelism depth. 
        // (2) We avoid repeating identical sequences of commands by referring to the earlier command chunk. But we would also like to
        // create a mechanism that allows us to generate similar sequences of commands, differing only in the relevant ordered source
        // indices and/or ordered destination indices. For example, we could specify a function that would translate ordered source
        // indices or ordered destination indices, so that we could load data or save data back to similar but distinct information sets.
        // For example, if we have a two round bargaining game, then we might want to use essentially the same code for the second round
        // of the bargaining regardless of how we ended up in the second round. If we could bracket an entire round of decisions, that
        // would greatly reduce the size of the tree and allow us to have more rounds (though still at considerable cost with regard 
        // to execution). Probably the way this would work would be to have a section of code where an original target is 
        // incremented by some value. That is, every set of round 1 information sets would be immediately be followed by round 2
        // information sets that follow it, except that each such information set would be followed by the following round 3 
        // information sets. The algorithm should thus be the same except for such values and (critically) for the final utilities,
        // whether the bargaining round leads to settlement or not. We would thus also need the final utilities values to be
        // set up in the same way, but this would require significant manual setup work, especially if the goal is to be able to
        // avoid playing every permutation of the game.
        // (3) Can we avoid revisiting when we repeat identical sequences, at least as an option? I think the challenge here is
        // with ReuseDestinations, since the numbers may go to different destinations.
